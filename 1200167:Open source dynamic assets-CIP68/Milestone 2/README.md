**Dear Reviewers,**

Thank you very much for your detailed and valuable feedback. We have carefully reviewed and made the necessary adjustments based on your suggestions. Specifically, we have created a video to explain how VPS specification, quotations from cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP) and the blockchain provider (Blockfrost) are made.

Regarding the demo video, we have created a new video that presents in detail the functionalities of the frontend and backend, helping you better understand how the modules actually work.

We hope these adjustments meet your requirements, and we look forward to receiving your feedback. Should you have any further questions or requests, please feel free to contact us.

Once again, thank you for taking the time and effort to review the project. We truly value your inputs.




## **1. Quotation from the vendors with similar specifications**  
We  made [a video](https://youtu.be/JLPLQbbqhjM) demonstrating how to sizing VPS specification and create qoutations on Cloud providers.

These are the exported qoutations based on the available features of the Cloud providers.
