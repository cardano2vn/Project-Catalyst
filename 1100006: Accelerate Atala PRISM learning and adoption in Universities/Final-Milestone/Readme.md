## Recording of supporting session and follow up plan
- **Recording of coaching session is at** [this link](https://youtu.be/1HOR4x4koLo)
- **Follow-up plan**:
  - Since Atalaprism has been sunsetted since October 1, 2024, many projects have changed their research direction and chosen a more suitable solution. We have a group of 04 students participating in student scientific research this year who all changed their topic after hearing this news.
  However, we continue to monitor the progress of Identus (formerly Atalaprism) to see if some of it can be applied in practice.
  - Monitor and explore alternatives to Identus if available
  - Continue to listen to the needs of project teams, if they are interested in DID we will explore suitable alternatives

## Pictures and summary as evidences
- We have evidence of 1-1 coaching for groups here:
  -  Coaching [Careblock Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhWtDi4xe0E?t=1913) in MS3
  -  Coaching [Student](https://youtu.be/JuiIePafo74) in MS4
  -  DID Coaching session [1/11/2024](https://youtu.be/1HOR4x4koLo) (above link)

Given that AtalaPrism has ceased further development, there are currently no student groups oriented towards utilizing this product, resulting in the unavailability of data regarding the number of projects employing AtalaPrism. Nonetheless, Project team continues to provide support and mentorship to students engaged in scientific research as per usual practices. Documentation of meetings can be found at:
