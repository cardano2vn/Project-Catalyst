## Recording of supporting session and follow up plan
- **Recording of coaching session is at** [this link](https://youtu.be/1HOR4x4koLo)
- **Follow-up plan**:
  - Since Atalaprism has been sunsetted since October 1, 2024, many projects have changed their research direction and chosen a more suitable solution. We have a group of 04 students participating in student scientific research this year who all changed their topic after hearing this news.
  However, we continue to monitor the progress of Identus (formerly Atalaprism) to see if some of it can be applied in practice.

 - Monitor and explore alternatives to Identus if available
   
 - Continue to listen to the needs of project teams, if they are interested in DID we will explore suitable alternatives
