## Pictures taken at 03 classes
Our initial goal was to have the course taught at only 2 schools with each class having more than 50 students. However, due to the busy time of many students taking semester exams and preparing projects, we had to expand the scope of implementation to teach at 3 schools and 1 online class to have a suitable time slot for more students.
