## Pictures taken at 03 classes
Our initial goal was to have the course taught at only 2 schools with each class having more than 50 students. However, due to the **busy time of many students taking semester exams and preparing projects**, we had to expand the scope of implementation to teach at 3 schools and** 1 online class to have a suitable time slot for more students**.
